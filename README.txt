# ROC: Retail Ontology for Climbing
====================================================================================

ROC provides an Ontology Design Pattern (ODP) for the integration of GoodRelations
in to a domain-specific ontology to create a customer- and business-oriented
solution that can be used in several scenarios.

The goals of this work are three-fold: to define a retail-oriented Ontology Design
Pattern (ODP) that makes it easier to understand and reuse GoodRelations, to show
how ontologies can be integrated with GoodRelations, and to illustrate several
concrete retail solutions enabled by the use of ontologies. The climbing gear
ontology "ROC" was created as a learning experience in knowledge engineering and ontoogy development.
